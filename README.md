# Gig Genie

## Concept
This project is <b>phase one</b> of a minimum viable product that allows users to sign up for open mics in their area. Using what we've learned in our bootcamp thus far we were able to:<br> 
- Utilize the Mapbox API to display a map with custom markers and geolocation search capabilities
- Utilize the City of Melbourne Open Data API to retrieve live music venue data and convert that into markers on our map
- Use Materialize for overall page styling / formatting including: navbar, modals, carousel and footer
- Store form submissions from users locally
